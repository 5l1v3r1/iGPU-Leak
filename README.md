# What happened?

A security issue was found on Intel integrated GPUs (iGPUs).
It allows attackers to leak private data from an iGPU.
Besides games, nowadays a large variety of software leverage GPU acceleration, e.g. web browsers and blockchains.
These applications are all at risk.
The problem is caused by defective GPU management of the graphics driver.
When an application uses the GPU, some private data inevitably get stored in GPU.
We find the graphics driver fails to wipe them after the application finishes, so the data preserve in the GPU.
Therefore, an attacker can run a GPU spyware to steal these private data.


For details, see [Technical explanation](#Technical-Explanation).

# Affected Products

Intel 3th to 10th Generation Core processors and many other Intel processor families are all affected. 

We recommend you to update the Intel Graphics driver as soon as it becomes available. Please refer to the Intel Security Advisory [INTEL-SA-00314](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00314.html) for the complete list of affected products and operating systems.

# Known Exploits

We are not aware of any exploitations in the wild.
However, we expect it is easy to develop attacks with the vulnerability.
According to our experiments, the following 2 attacks are possible. 

#### 1. Browser activity eavesdropping

By monitoring the Intel iGPU, an attacker may know which website the user is visiting.

#### 2. Key recovery attack against iGPU-accelerated ciphers

If you are using an iGPU for cryptographic tasks, the plaintext or even the key may be leaked due to the iGPU-Leak vulnerability.



## Technical-Explanation

This is an uninitialized data vulnerability in the Intel Graphics driver, and it results in information leakage through the GPU hardware.
In essence, the GPU state is not reset during a GPU context switch. 
We identify two components in Intel iGPUs that leak information due to this vulnerability: 1) shared local memory, and 2) the general register file (GRF) in every execution unit (EU).
